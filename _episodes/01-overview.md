This episode describes how we go about designing lessons and why.
For more information on how we design lessons and why,
see [the instructor training course][training].

2.  **Formative Assessments**:
    "back up" and "parallel park between some safety cones".

3.  **Connect the Dots**:
    put the formative assessments in order

In practice, the process often looks more like this:

1.  Draft the assumptions and major outcomes.

2.  Describe the summative assessments for each half day of material
    (i.e., one summative assessment for a three-hour lesson and two for a full-day lesson).

3.  Write a one- or two-line description of the formative assessments
    building up to those summative assessments.
    These should be paced at roughly 15-minute intervals,
    i.e.,
    four per hour.

4.  Get early feedback from peers,
    particularly on how realistic the time estimates are.

5.  Do a second pass to flesh out the assumptions and assessments.

6.  Get more feedback.

7.  Start writing the lesson content.

Once work starts on step 7,
the detailed milestones should be moved into lesson episode files.
For an example of this,
see the [novice Python lesson using the gapminder data][python-gapminder].
