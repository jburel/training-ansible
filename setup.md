This training session is in the form of a follow-along workshop.

To follow along, you'll need the following:

Requirements:
* Ansible (2.0+) 
* Virtualbox (5+)
* Vagrant (1.9+) 

## Installing the requirements

### Ansible
Here are the [installation instructions](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html) for all platforms. OSX users: I've personally installed Ansible with homebrew, using `brew install ansible`, though the Ansible project are currently recommending users install it via `pip`. I'd recomend trying homebrew, then pip if there are any problems.

> ## pip, El Capitan (10.11) and beyond
> 
> If you're using El Capitan (10.11) or a more recent version of OS X, you may be better installing to the pip `--user` scheme. See [these instructions](http://binarynature.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/install-ansible-on-os-x-el-capitan_30.html). Normal `pip` might well be fine - I'm definitely no expert here.
